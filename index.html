        <h3>How to Register a Company</h3>
        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <div class="faq">
            <div class="faq-section">
                <h4>How long will it take to register a company in the UK?</h4>
                <p>We will normally register your new company within three to six hours of you submitting your online application via our website. However, registering a company name within this timeframe does depend on how busy Companies House is on that day. For those who need to register a limited company urgently, we offer a guaranteed same-day formation service (orders should be submitted before 15:00 GMT on any business day). You will receive all the official paperwork in your email inbox as soon as your company is registered at Companies House.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h4>What documents will I get as proof of my new company incorporation?</h4>
                <p>As soon as Companies House approves your online company registration application, your documents will be on the way. You will receive electronic copies of your certificate of incorporation with your unique company number, memorandum and articles of association, and share certificates for all shareholders via email. If applicable, printed documents will be posted in the mail to all relevant company directors within 24 hours.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h4>What information should I provide to form my new company?</h4>
                <p>When setting up and registering a new business, you need to choose a unique company name to provide Companies House. You will also need to provide the full name, email address, residential address or business address, date of birth, nationality, business occupation, telephone number, town of birth and eye colour of each director/shareholder to form and register a UK limited company. If you don’t have a business address you can use, our virtual address services can provide all you need to acquire a legally registered office.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h4>As a director, do I have to publish my home address on the public record?</h4>
                <p>Once you register a limited company, all directors must submit their residential address and a service address. Both the addresses can be the same or different. By choosing a different service address, you can keep your home address confidential. Our company director’s address service allows directors to hide their home address from the internet, marketing agencies and the general public.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h4>What documents are required to register a UK limited company?</h4>
                <p>Registering a company and your business name with Companies House does not require an endless amount of paperwork that goes into minute details. You don’t even need specific documents to hand for us to register your UK limited company. Once you register your company name and the registration process is complete, we will ask you to send your identification and proof of address within 30 days to comply with AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h4>How do I choose and register a company name?</h4>
                <p>If you are registering a new private limited company, you must choose a unique name for your business. To register a company name, you must make sure the name ends with either "Limited" or "Ltd", or the Welsh equivalents ("Cyfyngedig" or "Cyf"). Your company name cannot be the same (or similar) to another registered company’s name.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h4>Do I need to appoint a director for my new company?</h4>
                <p>Yes. You must appoint a director for your new company. Your UK limited company must have at least one director over the age of 16. Directors are legally responsible for running the company, filing accounts and submitting official paperwork. Another company can also be a director, but at least one of your directors must be a person.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h4>Can you help me get a business bank account with Barclays or Lloyds?</h4>
                <p>Once you register a company name, we can help you set up a business bank account with Barclays or Lloyds via a fast-track application process. Please note that this offer is available for UK residents only. We have other business banking options for non-UK residents.</p>
